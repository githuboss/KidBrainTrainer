<p style="color: white;font-family:Comic Sans MS">Food chain is a linear network of links in a food web starting from 
producer organisms (such as grass or trees which use radiation from the Sun to make their food) and ending at 
apex predator species (like grizzly bears or killer whales), detritivores (like earthworms or woodlice), or decomposer species 
(such as fungi or bacteria). A food chain also shows how the organisms are related with each other by the food they eat. 
Each level of a food chain represents a different trophic level. A food chain differs from a food web, 
because the complex network of different animals' feeding relations are aggregated and the chain only follows a direct, 
linear pathway of one animal at a time. Natural interconnections between food chains make it a food web. 
A common metric used to quantify food web trophic structure is food chain length. In its simplest form, 
the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web and the 
mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web.

<h3 style="color: white;font-family:Comic Sans MS;border-radius: 8px;";>Did you know?</h3>
<p style="color: white;font-family:Comic Sans MS">Food chains were first introduced by the African-Arab scientist and philosopher 
Al-Jahiz in the 9th century and later popularized in a book published in 1927 by Charles Elton, 
which also introduced the food web concept.
